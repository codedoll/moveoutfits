**How to use**
 - Drag and drop items to desired location
 - Hit the "**save**" button. Important!!! Otherwise, the new order will **not** be saved.

**Struggles**
 - Logic behind database query sort
 - Finding a good library for drag and drop functionality
 - The library I used was either not agreeing with my CSS styling or needs better DOM control on horizontal ordering
 - Deciding if the items should be auto-save. I decided not to auto save the items due to the possibility of clients making a mistake while dragging and dropping, and making the website much more slower due to the additional digest-loops involved.
